#Boise State R User's Group
The Boise State R User's Group is a semi-structured working group for R, with specific focus on ecology, biology, sociology, conservation science, and geosciences. Our group seeks to provide assistance to beginner - intermediate level R users in data management, analysis, and visualization. In addition to supporting technical R skills, we host bi-weekly tutorials on a variety of usable R skills. Attendance is welcomed and appreciated by all student and staff members at Boise State. We will provide refreshments at all meetings when possible. Please download R and preferably R-Studio prior to arrival. [Download R here!] (https://www.r-project.org/)

General attendance is 10-20 students.
